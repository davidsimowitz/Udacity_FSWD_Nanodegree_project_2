P2: Portfolio Site

Cross-device compatibility is essential when designing a site, especially since more than half of all internet traffic originates from mobile devices. Therefore, this project's focus was to design and implement a portfolio website—displaying images, descriptions, and links to each of the projects completed throughout the course of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree—that adheres to responsive web design.


Requirements
------------

+ A Web Browser such as [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) is installed.
+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed.
  (Optional, if you wish to clone the project repository.)


Usage
-----

* Run the following commands to clone the complete web site.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/davidsimowitz/fullstack-nanodegree-project-2.git
```
  + Above command is optional.
  + Alternatively you may download the files into the directory.

```bash
$ cd fullstack-nanodegree-project-2
```
  + Verify the following files/folders are present before continuing:
    * css
    * font-awesome
    * img
    * js
    * movie-trailer
    * responsive
    * index.html


* Double click index.html to run the site.
